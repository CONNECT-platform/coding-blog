> This is **`coding.blog`**

A blog platform for developers, for everything coding.
*Not* for content-marketing disguised as programming tutorials.
*Not* for advertisement blended with sincerely interesting pieces.
*Quality*. *Articles*. *About*. *Coding*.

# Today ...

Today, it feels like most articles are trying to sell you something. They are,
as they cannot reach you for free. Curators like Medium need to put work into
ensuring you get the articles you would enjoy. To compensate, they either
put the content behind paywalls or shift the costs to the authors. Now authors
need to bear the cost, they need to make sure their writings are selling you something.

No one is evil here. The process makes everything either hidden behind a paywall or 
an ad dressed up as a coding blog. The process needs to change.

# Tomorrow ...

With `coding.blog`, we want to change that. 

We want to help authors write elegant, modern coding blogs while retaining ownership of their work.

We believe authors should rely on the support and appreciation
of the community for sharing their knowledge, not on the support of companies who
monetize your time and attention to convince you to buy from them.

We want quality writings on coding to be freely available to everyone.
We want to empower authors so that they do not have to disguise their
content to sell other stuff to you indirectly. The software
community has thrived on sharing openly and honestly. This is how we should
move forward.

> _How?_

- `coding.blog` will make every article available for free, while allowing
the community to support the authors by tipping them.

- `coding.blog` will offer per-user curated lists to readers who want it, for a small monthly fee.
Curation is never really free, but with transparent direct pricing, it can become
free of content that is there only to convince you to buy something, leaving only content
that you would truly enjoy.

- `coding.blog` will provide an [open-source toolchain](https://codedoc.cc) for building 
elegant blogs, offering the convenience of platforms like Medium, rich features specificly 
designed for writing about programming, and customizability that only comes 
with open-source tools.

- `coding.blog` will pull new content from git repos maintained by authors, build
them using the same toolchain, publish them and queue them for curation. In other words,
the authors retain full control and ownership over their work.

> that `coding.blog` is still in early development stages and these details might change
> as we better figure out what works and what doesn't.
