# Today ...

Today, it feels like most articles are trying to sell you something. They are,
as they cannot reach you for free. Curators like Medium need to put work into
ensuring you get the articles you would enjoy. To compensate, they either
put the content behind paywalls or shift the costs to the authors. They also curate with only the content available on their platform. 

However, there is a tonne of content out there. The problem is finding truly insightful pieces based on your personal needs is time-consuming.

# Tomorrow ...

With `coding.blog`, we want to change that. 

We want quality writings on coding blog to be freely available to everyone.
We want to empower authors to write elegant, modern coding blogs while retaining ownership of their work.
The software community has thrived on sharing openly and honestly. This is how we should
move forward.


> :Big

> _How?_

- `coding.blog` will make every article available for free. Our curation service will not be restricted to articles published only on our platform but will curate from a pool of all freely accessible articles. 

- `coding.blog` will offer personalised curated lists based on your needs. We will charge a small monthly fee for this. Curation is never really free, but with transparent direct pricing, it can become
free of content that is there only to convince you to buy something, leaving only content
that you would truly enjoy.

- `coding.blog` will provide an [open-source toolchain](https://codedoc.cc) for building 
elegant blogs, offering the convenience of platforms like Medium, rich features specifically 
designed for writing about programming, and customizability that only comes 
with open-source tools.

- `coding.blog` will pull new content from git repos maintained by authors, build
them using the same toolchain, publish them and queue them for curation. In other words,
the authors retain full control and ownership over their work.

> If you are curious about how will `coding.blog` work for creators and authors, checkout
> [this section](/creators#how-will-it-help) of the ["For Creators"](/creators) page. Note
> that `coding.blog` is still in early development stages and these details might change
> as we better figure out what works and what doesn't.
